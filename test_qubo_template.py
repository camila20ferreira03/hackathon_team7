"""
Test suite for ``qubo_template``
===============================

This module exercises the functions provided in ``qubo_template``.  It
starts by compiling the template to ensure there are no syntax errors.
Then, if Qiskit is available, it constructs a simple QUBO instance,
solves it exactly with a classical solver, and optionally runs QAOA
for demonstration.  If Qiskit is not installed, the tests are skipped
with informative output.
